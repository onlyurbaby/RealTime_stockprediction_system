# RealTime_stockprediction_system
"A real-time stock prediction system using yfinance to fetch 1-min interval data, preprocess it, apply ML models (e.g., LSTM), and enhance accuracy with features like RSI &amp; moving averages. Predicted prices are visualized in a Power BI dashboard for instant insights."
Stock prediction includes techniques which are used in deep learning and machine learning. Statistics and mathematical expressions plays an crucial role in building stock prediction systems.
Creating a real time system tends in interlinking of the system with the real time data which is gathered continously.
